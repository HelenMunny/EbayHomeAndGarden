# EbayHomeAndGarden
In this project, I have tried to test ebay.com's Home &amp; Garden page using java as the programming language, Selenium as the automation framework, Page Object Model (POM) as design principles, and TestNG for organizing tests. In addition, I have used TestNG Listeners implementing ITestListener for listening to the tests and taking screenshots, and Apache POI for reading and writing files.
